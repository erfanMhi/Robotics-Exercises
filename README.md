# Introduction to Robotics book Programming Assignments
    Solutions for the Introduction to Robotics book Programming Exercises
## Prerequisites
1. Install [Numpy](https://www.continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda Official Website")
    ```sh
    $ pip install numpy
    ```
2. Install [Robopy](https://adityadua24.github.io/robopy/)
    ```sh
    $ pip install robopy
    ```
## Usage

You can run the assignments by iterating these steps:
  1. Clone the repository
  
  2. Go (cd) to exercisexx directory where xx is the number of assignment and chapter's number consecutively:
  ```sh
    $ cd exercisexx
  ```
  3. Run the command below with different n parameters as input to see results of different section of the assignment:
  ```sh
    $ python main.py -n t
  ```
 Where t is the name of a subsection of the assignment (i.e 'a' or 'b')
